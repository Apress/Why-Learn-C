# Why Learn C: Source Code

This directory contains
the C source code
for the larger examples
in the book
_Why Learn C_.

The source files are arranged
to make direct inclusion
into a LaTeX document
via the `\lstinputlisting` command
easy.
Specifically,
larger examples
are split into several files
so each can be included seperately.
